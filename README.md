# D3.js - An Animal Crossing Twitter Visualization

This is a reformatted code for a data visualization team project I worked on. This code is representative of the parts of the project I worked on and the visualization/code I designed to service our teams' goal to scrape Animal Crossing Twitter data around the time of the New Horizons 2.0 update. The visualization's goal was to show what topics and moods the Twitter community was experiencing about the update through analysis of emoji usage.
